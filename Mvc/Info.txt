Quick Start

Add a reference to Omnisoft.Api.Connector.dll (You can find a pre-compiled version in the build folder of this repository or install Stripe.net via NuGet)

Next you will need to provide Stripe.net with your api key. There are 3 ways to do this: Choose one.

a) Add an AppSetting with your api key to your config (this is the easiest way)

<appSettings>
...
    <add key="OmnisoftApiKey" value="[your api key here]" />
...
</appSettings>
b) In your application initialization, call (this is a programmatic way, but you only have to do it once during startup)

OmnisoftConfiguration.SetApiKey("[your api key here]");
c) In any of the service constructors documented below, you can optionally pass the api key (not recommended for single app/single key use). i.e...

var planService = new StripePlanService("[your api key here]");
Use the library :)
